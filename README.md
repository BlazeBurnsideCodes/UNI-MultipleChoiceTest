# UNI-MultipleChoiceTest
A university project where we were required to design a desktop application that could be used by students and teachers to create and take multiple choice tests.

Year 2.

Note, some design choices may seem odd due to this being a university issued assessment meant to display an understanding of what had been taught in lectures.
